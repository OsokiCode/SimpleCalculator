# Calculator Java Swing Application

## About the Project

A simple calculator application built using Java Swing.  
Provides an easy-to-use interface and supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, and decimal numbers.

## Features

- Number and operation buttons for easy interaction  
- Keyboard shortcuts supported (e.g., 0-9, +, -, *, /, Backspace, Enter)  
- `Del` button to delete the last character  
- `Clr` button to clear the display  
- Negation button `(-)` to toggle positive/negative numbers  
- Error handling for cases like division by zero  

## Usage

- Run the `Calculator` class to start the application.  
- Perform calculations using either buttons or keyboard shortcuts.  
- Backspace deletes the last character, and Enter calculates the result.  

## Technologies Used

- Java SE  
- Swing GUI Toolkit  

## Development Notes

- The user interface is created using `JFrame` and `JPanel`.  
- Buttons have `ActionListener`s to handle user interactions.  
- Keyboard shortcuts are implemented via `InputMap` and `ActionMap`.  
- Calculations use the `double` data type.  

## Future Improvements

- Support for parentheses and operation precedence  
- Display of calculation history  
- More modern and responsive UI design  
- Additional functions (square root, power, percentage, etc.)
